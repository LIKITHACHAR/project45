  """
  Simplified AO* Search on a graph with dynamic cost updates.

  **Note:** This is a simplified version that doesn't handle AND-OR graphs
          and full consistency maintenance. It's for illustrative purposes.

  Args:
      graph: A dictionary representing the graph, where keys are nodes and values are lists of (neighbor, cost) tuples.
      start_node: The starting node for the search.
      goal_node: The goal node to find.
      heuristic: A function that takes a node as input and returns a heuristic score (lower score indicates closer to goal).

  Returns:
      A list containing the nodes visited in the order of exploration,
      or None if no path is found to the goal.
